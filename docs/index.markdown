Introducing TsingTao
====================

TsingTao is a custom mod for those cheap Chinese consoles you can find on the Internet,
like the one below:

![Cheap handeld console from AliExpress](/tsing-tao-console-mod/assets/img/intro/console.png)
{: refdef}

The goal of this mod is to reuse the following components of this console:
- console shell and lid
- 1020 mAh battery
- power and battery management circuit
- TFT screen
- speaker

This mod runs with a [Retro-Go](https://github.com/ducalex/retro-go) based firmware on a ESP32-based system and is able to
correctly emulate ROMS for the following consoles:
- Nintendo NES
- Nintendo GameBoy & GameBoy Color
- SEGA Game Gear
- SEGA Master System
- PC Engine
- Atari Lynx
