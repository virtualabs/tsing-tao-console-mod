This PCB should look like the one below (note that there are a lot of variants for these handeld consoles, it is very likely that your PCB differs from the one showed here): . Disconnect the screen from the PCB: gently lift the socket’s lip with a plastic tool (avoid using a blade or a flat screwdriver as it may damage the screen’s ribbon) and caregully remove the ribbon from the socket. Keep this screen far from the workbench to avoid any scratch or damage (required in the final build). Desolder the speaker using a soldering iron and a pair of tweezers. Keep it in a secure place to avoid any damage, we will need it later. ",
